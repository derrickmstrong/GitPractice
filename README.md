Creating a Repo first then cloning it locally

Note: 
- DO NOT create a local folder first. Git will do that for you through the cloning process.
- Create a new Repo WITH a README.md via GitHub
- In the Terminal, navigate to the Source directory (or main directory)
- Use git clone (repo url) ie. git clone https://github.com/derrickmstrong/GitPractice.git to link the remote and local repos
- Now I can git status, git add, git commit, and git push to the remote version on GitHub

This is definitely my preferred way to start off a new project.
